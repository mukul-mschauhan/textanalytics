## Project Airline Sentiment Analysis
### Overview
This project aims to predict the sentiments expressed in customer feedback related to an airline. Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer opinions and enhancing the overall customer experience. In this specific problem, we focus on analyzing tweets to determine whether they convey positive, neutral, or negative sentiments.

### Business Context: Why Recall Matters More
For an airline, identifying negative customer feedback is paramount. Failing to detect negative sentiments can lead to serious consequences, including customer churn, brand damage, and missed opportunities for service improvement. Therefore, in this sentiment analysis scenario, recall—the ability to correctly identify as many negative sentiments as possible—is of utmost importance.

### Precision vs. Recall: The Trade-off
While precision (correctly identifying negative feedback without too many false positives) is important, a slightly lower precision is acceptable in this context. The rationale is that it's less harmful to mistakenly classify some neutral or positive sentiments as negative than to miss out on identifying actual negative feedback.

- Recall Focus: Prioritizing recall helps in capturing a larger proportion of negative sentiments, minimizing the risk of overlooking dissatisfied customers.
- Precision Trade-off: Although a high precision rate is ideal, in this scenario, the airline would benefit more from ensuring that negative feedback is not missed, even if it means occasionally flagging neutral or positive feedback as negative.

### Example Scenario
Imagine a tweet that expresses mild dissatisfaction, which might be misclassified as neutral by a model with low recall. Missing this negative sentiment could result in the airline not addressing the issue, leading to potential customer dissatisfaction. On the other hand, if a neutral or slightly positive tweet is mistakenly flagged as negative (lower precision), the airline can still review it without significant harm.

### Conclusion
In the context of airline sentiment analysis, prioritizing recall over precision ensures that the airline is more proactive in addressing customer concerns and improving service quality. This approach helps the airline maintain a strong customer relationship by promptly responding to potential issues highlighted in customer feedback.
